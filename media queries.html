            <h1>The City Of Warri</h1>
            <p>Uvwie, is a principal Urban Local Government Area in Delta State. It lies along the Warri River and it is one of the twenty-four Urhobo Kingdoms. The entirety of the LGA is conurbated with the city of Warri, making it a greater part of Warri metropolitan area. The term Uvwie primarily refers to the indigenous people of the geographic region, Uvwie also doubles as the name of the language and the Kingdom of Uvwie. More recently, Effurun which is the traditional and political headquarters of Uvwie Kingdom/Local Government Area. Uvwie is now used to refer to the city herself which is a twin city to the city of Warri.</p>
            <p>The introduction of British colonialism in the late nineteenth century made Uvwie to become part of modern-day Nigeria which was created by the amalgamation of the Protectorates of Northern and Southern Nigeria in 1914. Since then foreign cultural pins like changes in the system of governance, dress codes, diets, Uvwie traditional architecture, economic activities and language have been inserted in the traditional culture. In response, the Uvwie traditional culture has strived to be assertive, on the one hand, and accepted to be an undercurrent, on the other hand. </p>
